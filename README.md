# HappiNUS

Level of Achievement: Apollo

## 📌 Project Scope

**One-sentence version:**  
An anonymous peer-to-peer support platform that connects NUS students with trained peer mentors to foster mental well-being without stigma.

**Descriptive version:**  
**HappiNUS** is an application-based platform designed to provide accessible and confidential mental health support within university residences. Motivated by recent suicide attempts in Prince George's Park Residences and our experiences as peer mentors, this platform aims to address the limitations of existing mental health resources—chiefly, the fear of judgment. HappiNUS enables students to initiate anonymous conversations with peer mentors, ensuring emotional safety while offering essential features like AI-assisted chat summarisation, emergency broadcasting, and privacy-respecting chat controls. The goal is to cultivate a compassionate and inclusive support system, starting from LightHouse and expanding to the wider NUS community.

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Ideation

### 🔍 Problem Motivation
Recent incidents at Prince George's Park Residences have highlighted the urgent need for better, stigma-free mental health support. As peer mentors in LightHouse, we’ve witnessed firsthand how the lack of anonymity discourages students from seeking help. Existing support systems, while present, are often underutilized due to concerns about confidentiality and fear of judgment.
