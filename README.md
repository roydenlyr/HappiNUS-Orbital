# HappiNUS

**Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11 🚀

---

## 📌 Project Scope

**One-sentence version:**  
An anonymous peer-to-peer support platform that connects NUS students with trained peer mentors to foster mental well-being without stigma.

**Descriptive version:**  
**HappiNUS** is an application-based platform aimed at providing accessible and confidential mental health support within university residences. Prompted by recent suicide attempts in Prince George's Park Residences and informed by our experience as peer mentors, we identified a critical gap in existing support systems—primarily, the fear of being judged. HappiNUS empowers students to seek help anonymously, allowing them to connect with peer mentors through secure, stigma-free communication. Core features include AI-assisted chat summarisation, emergency alert broadcasting, and privacy-enhancing chat controls. We envision starting with LightHouse and eventually extending to the entire NUS campus community.

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Ideation

### 🔍 Problem Motivation
Recent mental health incidents at Prince George's Park Residences underscore the need for accessible, stigma-free support. As peer mentors ourselves, we’ve seen how concerns over confidentiality deter students from using existing resources. HappiNUS aims to remove this barrier by enabling anonymous, emotionally safe conversations between students and peer mentors.

### 💡 Proposed Core Features / User Stories

#### 👨‍🎓 Students
- Select peer mentors based on faculty, year, gender, and other preferences.
- Initiate fully anonymous chats with a chosen peer mentor.
- Access curated external resources for mental health support.

#### 🤝 Peer Mentors
- Offer moral and emotional support through real-time chat.
- Review previous chats using a summarisation tool.
- Seamlessly transfer conversations to another mentor (with student consent).
- Trigger **Red Alert** notifications to mobilize support in emergencies.
- Receive AI-suggested responses to enhance emotional communication.

#### 🛠 Administrators
- Manage mentor accounts (add/remove).
- *(Pending decision)* Access to chat history, balancing oversight with privacy.
